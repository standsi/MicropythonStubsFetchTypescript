# Implementation Summary: MicroPython Library Support

## Objective
Implement code in `src/librarySupport.ts` that provides library installation functionality as described in `librarySupport.md`.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Functions

1. **Package Index Management**
   - `downloadPackageIndex()`: Downloads package index from micropython.org
   - `loadPackageIndexFromFile()`: Loads package index from local JSON file
   - `findPackage()`: Finds a package by name in the index

2. **Repository Download**
   - `downloadMicropythonLibZip()`: Downloads the micropython-lib repository as a ZIP file from GitHub

3. **Package Extraction**
   - `extractPackageFromZip()`: Extracts specific package folders from the ZIP using zip-lib with filtering

4. **Dependency Management**
   - `parseManifestRequires()`: Parses manifest.py files to extract require() statements
   - `installPackageWithDependencies()`: Recursively installs packages and their dependencies

5. **File Management**
   - `copyPackageToLib()`: Copies package files to /lib directory
   - `isInstallableFile()`: Helper to filter installable files
   - `copyDirRecursive()`: Helper for recursive directory copying with merge support

6. **Main Orchestration**
   - `main()`: High-level function that coordinates the entire installation process

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm (as per librarySupport.md)

1. ✅ Download/load package index JSON
2. ✅ Find package by name and extract path field
3. ✅ Download micropython-lib repository as ZIP
4. ✅ Extract folder matching path from ZIP using zip-lib with onEntry callback
5. ✅ Copy .py/.mpy files (excluding manifest.py and test files) to /lib
6. ✅ Handle package folders by copying to /lib and preserving existing contents
7. ✅ Parse manifest.py for require() statements
8. ✅ Recursively process dependencies (up to MAX_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH)

### Key Features

- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolves and installs dependencies recursively
- **Smart File Handling**: Distinguishes between single-file packages and folder-based packages
- **Test File Exclusion**: Automatically excludes test files (starting with `test_`)
- **Directory Merging**: Properly merges package folders when dependencies share directories
- **Configurable Behavior**: Constants for URLs, paths, and depth limits
- **Optional Cleanup**: Configurable lib directory cleanup

### Testing

Successfully tested with:
1. **neopixel**: Simple package with single .py file
   - Result: `lib/neopixel.py` created correctly
   
2. **collections-defaultdict**: Package with dependencies
   - Dependencies: requires 'collections' package
   - Result: 
     - `lib/collections/__init__.py` (from collections)
     - `lib/collections/defaultdict.py` (from collections-defaultdict)
   - Both files merged correctly into single collections folder

## Code Quality

### Security
- ✅ Passed CodeQL security scan with 0 alerts
- No security vulnerabilities detected

### Code Review Improvements
- ✅ Extracted magic numbers to named constants (MAX_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH, LOCAL_INDEX_PATH)
- ✅ Created helper function `isInstallableFile()` for better maintainability
- ✅ Made lib directory cleanup optional via parameter
- ✅ Used configurable constants for hardcoded paths

## Files Changed/Created

1. `src/librarySupport.ts` - Main implementation (354 lines)
2. `.gitignore` - Added lib/ to exclusions
3. `LIBRARY_SUPPORT_USAGE.md` - Usage documentation
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Dependencies Used

- `axios`: HTTP requests for downloading package index and ZIP file
- `zip-lib`: ZIP file extraction with filtering
- `fs`, `path`, `os`: Node.js built-in modules for file system operations

## How It Works

```typescript
// Example: Installing neopixel
main('neopixel', true, true)
  ↓
1. Load package index (from local or remote)
  ↓
2. Download micropython-lib.zip from GitHub
  ↓
3. Find 'neopixel' in index → path: 'micropython/drivers/led/neopixel'
  ↓
4. Extract micropython-lib-master/micropython/drivers/led/neopixel/ from ZIP
  ↓
5. Parse manifest.py → no dependencies
  ↓
6. Copy neopixel.py to lib/neopixel.py
  ↓
7. Clean up temp files
```

## Compliance with Requirements

The implementation follows all steps outlined in `librarySupport.md`:

- ✅ Step 1: Download package index JSON
- ✅ Step 2: Select package from index
- ✅ Step 3: Download micropython-lib repo as ZIP
- ✅ Step 4: Extract folder using zip-lib with onEntry callback
- ✅ Step 5: Copy .py/.mpy files (excluding manifest.py) to /lib
- ✅ Step 6: Copy package folders to /lib with content preservation
- ✅ Step 7: Parse manifest.py for require() statements
- ✅ Step 8: Recursively process dependencies

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully provides a complete MicroPython library installation system that matches the specification in librarySupport.md. It has been tested with the provided examples and passes all security checks.
